# Vue.js Discovery Clone

This demo is a [Discovery](http://discoverydemo.massiveprocess.com/)'s clone that I coded with [Vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue). Front-end application of a component-based reporting system.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
